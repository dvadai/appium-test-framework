First, I am going to focus on Android setup. In the prerequisites it says you need to download the Android ADK but you also need to set up an emulator first. 

# How to set up an emulator
1. Download android studio and install it
2. Open and create a project
3. Open and? Manager to bring up the simulators 
4. Download a system image for the operating system version we want
5. Create a new virtual device 
6. Drag and drop the app onto the emulator
7. Open the app and voila
